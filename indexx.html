<h1><U>Kanye </U></h1>
<p> 
I really love music. I have been to 8 concerts and have enjoyed every one of them. Most recently I went to a band named Wolf Alice. They have an album called Blue Weekend. I am getting off track now, this website is about Kanye West. He is literally a pioneer in the music industry and popularized the use of 808s after it lost popularity in the 80s. Although he has an eccentric personality, he is creative with his production arguably better than Pharrell Williams and Dr. Dre. His most recent album Donda was very unique. I will put some lyrics from his songs to get my word count more. 

<p> Forever, ever </p>
<p> Can you hear me? (Yeah)</p>
<p> Forever-ever, forever, forever, no </p>
<p> Glorious, glory, glory, glory </p>
<p> Glory, glory, glory, glory </p>
<p> It feels good to be home </p>
<p> And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support </p>
<p> For your support of me for so many years </p>
<p> And more importantly, for the work you continue to do </p>
<p> What did he want me to talk about? </p>
<p> Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous </p>
<p> He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to </p>
<p> And you know, I am my son's mother </p>
<p> The man I described in the introduction is being so decidedly different, my son (every time) </p>
<p> And what made the project extra special to me is </p>
<p> I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me </p>
<p> But what he has meant to a generation (today's the time)</p>
<p> As one writer said, we came from somewhere </p>
<p> Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers </p>
<p> But from a long line of generations who came before us </p>
<p> Is the kingdom (is the kingdom)</p>
<p> And the power (and the power) </p>
<p> And the glory (and the glory)</p>
<p> Forever (forever)</p>
<p> Is the kingdom (is the kingdom)</p>
<p> And the power (and the power)</p>
<p> And the glory (and the glory)</p>
<p> Forever (forever)
